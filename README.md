A full compress and decompress pipeline for huffman coding trees.

The goal is to compress text files using the huffman coding algorithm to efficiently encode files using a huffman tree and also be able to decompress encoded files into their original state.

Treenode.h outlines the tree structure used, and huffman.cpp is the only modified file that includes rigorous testing.
